# Improper Exception Handling in Dart Asynchronous Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart asynchronous programming: improper exception handling. The provided code showcases a scenario where an exception is caught, re-thrown, and then handled in a higher-level function, but the program continues without explicitly addressing the error. This can lead to unexpected behavior or data inconsistencies.

## Bug Description:
The `fetchData` function fetches data from a remote API.  It includes a `try-catch` block for error handling. However, the `rethrow` statement propagates any caught exceptions upward.  The `main` function also has a `try-catch` block, which catches these exceptions. However, after catching the exception, the program continues executing without any further action, potentially masking a serious error.

## Solution:
The solution provides improved error handling by logging the error more thoroughly and preventing the program from continuing after a critical error.  Appropriate error handling ensures the application behaves reliably and prevents unexpected behavior in the event of API failures or other issues.
